This is a django project created to allow easier setting up a date for meeting with my friends (who are apparently very busy people).
Although similar websites already exist, I find them really clutered and they often require creating accounts, which I don't like. Because of that this project allows users to create their meetings without any authentication.

The project is (or rather should be) hosted here: https://meet-date-picker.vercel.app/ or https://meet-date-picker-git-vercelproduction-marcinzareba03-gmailcom.vercel.app/ (if I make a bad commit the website will go down, so use responsibly)
